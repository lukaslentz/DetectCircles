Here you can find a python programm, that starts a gui-based application that can be used to detect circles in any kind of picture.
On the left hand side of the gui you will find three sliders that control the va√∂ues for hsv-filtering. 
The sliders on the right hand side are used to control the parameters that are used for the detection of hough-circles.
